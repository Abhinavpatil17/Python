# STEPS OF DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT :

4. Analyze the data to get useful insights.
   - Jitna bhgi data ka analysis hoga vo problem statement ko dhyan me rakhte hue hoga..
   - Problem statement include 2 things :- Formality research question and the Hypothesis.
   - RESEARCH QUESTION : Aap kon kon se questions ke answer find krna chahte ho apne data analysis project se.
   - HYPOTHESIS : Aap 1 taqrah ka assumption bnate ho ya posibility bnate ho ki me data analysis krne ja rha hu or yeh jo question hai uska answer yeh hona chahiye . 
      Hypothesis jo hai vo hmko last me ptqa chlega ki hmne jo hypothesis bnaya tha (jo assumptions create kiyeb the vo TRUe the ya FALSE the.
